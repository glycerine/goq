## Golang nanomsg bindings

Package nanomsg adds language bindings for nanomsg in Go. nanomsg is a
high-performance implementation of several "scalability protocols". See
http://nanomsg.org/ for more information.

This is a work in progress. nanomsg is still in a pre-alpha stage. Expect its
API, or this binding, to change.
