// Convey is the method intended for use when declaring the scopes
// of a specification. Each scope has a description and a func()
// which may contain other calls to Convey(), Reset() or Should-style
// assertions. Convey calls can be nested as far as you see fit.
//
// IMPORTANT NOTE: The top-level Convey() within a Test method
// must conform to the following signature:
//
//     Convey(description string, t *testing.T, action func())
//
// All other calls should like like this (no need to pass in *testing.T):
//
//     Convey(description string, action func())
//
// Don't worry, the goconvey will panic if you get it wrong so you can fix it.
//
// See the examples package for, well, examples.

// FocusConvey is has the inverse effect of SkipConvey. If the top-level
// Convey is changed to `FocusConvey`, only nested scopes that are defined
// with FocusConvey will be run. The rest will be ignored completely. This
// is handy when debugging a large suite that runs a misbehaving function
// repeatedly as you can disable all but one of that function
// without swaths of `SkipConvey` calls, just a targeted chain of calls
// to FocusConvey.
